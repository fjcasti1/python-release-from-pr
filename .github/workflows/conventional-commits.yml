                      Hey there! üëãüèº

                      We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

                      It looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.

                      Details:

                      ```
                      ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message }}
                      ```

            # Delete a previous comment when the issue has been resolved
            - if: ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message == null }}
